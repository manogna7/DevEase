## **What Makes DevEase Unique?**

### **1. AI + Visual Editor Combo**
- Unlike traditional website builders (e.g., Wix, Squarespace), DevEase combines **AI-powered code generation** with a **visual editor**. This means users can start with AI-generated code and then customize it visually, giving them full control over their website.

### **2. Framework Flexibility**
- Most website builders only output static HTML/CSS. DevEase allows users to generate code for modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, making it ideal for developers and businesses alike.

### **3. No-Code + Pro-Code in One**
- Beginners can use the visual editor and pre-built templates without touching code.
- Developers can start with AI-generated code and refine it further, saving hours of repetitive work.

### **4. Real-Time Collaboration**
- Unlike other tools, DevEase allows teams to collaborate in real-time on website projects, making it perfect for agencies and remote teams.

### **5. AI That Understands Context**
- DevEase’s AI doesn’t just generate generic code—it understands user intent and context. For example:
  - Input: "A responsive navbar with a logo on the left and links on the right."
  - Output: A fully functional, mobile-friendly navbar component.

### **6. Open-Ended Creativity**
- While other tools limit users to pre-defined templates, DevEase allows users to describe **anything** and generate it. From simple landing pages to complex dashboards, the possibilities are endless.

### **7. Export and Ownership**
- Unlike closed platforms, DevEase lets users export their code and own it completely. No vendor lock-in—take your code and deploy it anywhere.
